# Containerlab Project
My expeirence learning and working with containerlab

## Overview

This will serve to document my experiences working with containerlab and learning container networking. My main objects are: 
1) Learn how container networking functions
2) Become more familiar with containers
3) Successfully configure a container network

**KVM Resources:**
```
Hardware:
2 CPUs
4GB of RAM
25GB of storage

OS:
