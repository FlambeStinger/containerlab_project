# Project Summary and Conclusion #
A summary and conclusion on the project

## Summary ##
This personal project started because I wanted to learn more about containers and build a homelab without the need of having the physical equipement. The project's objectives were: 
1) Learn how container networking functions
2) Become more familiar with containers
3) Learn SRLinux
4) Successfully configure a container network

The original toplogy consisted of three nodes and two clients deployed in a spine and leaf architecture, and the setup was deployed and ran inside of a Ubunutu Server virtual machine.
